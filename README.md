# Recipes by Ingredients bot
You have lots of different, seemingly incompatible products in your fridge, but no idea what you can make with them. Or you're in favour of zero-waste cooking and make sure that every product is fully utilised to make a dish. Maybe you just want to try cooking dishes made up of your favourite ingredients, but haven't put your mind to how they can be combined to make a delicious dish. 

While cookery books make you buy more and more, this Telegram bot tells you how to make the most of the foods you already have in your fridge. If you want to, by adding, a couple of extra ingredients, you can greatly expand the range of dishes available, which ready-made recipes and cooking websites don't allow you to do.
